# RFID-Project-with-java
This is a simple project for demonstrating RFID tag reader with javaFX and Oracle database.
* I attached a file called SQLQueries.txt that contains sql commands related to this project.
* All you need for this project is a RFID tag, RC522, Arduino Uno R3 (you can use other different types)
* All of the database settings exit in setting.txt in resources folder of the project including database driver name, URL, user name and     password. You can change it to yours.
* also thanks Nazir_Ahmmed
